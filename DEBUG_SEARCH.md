# Search Bar Debug Report

## Current State Analysis
- Only ONE search input exists in the code (line 523 in home.tsx)
- No Google SearchBox or Autocomplete components found
- User continues to report seeing multiple search bars
- Search functionality implemented inline with onChange and onKeyPress

## Possible Causes
1. Browser cache not clearing properly
2. Service worker or cached JavaScript
3. Hidden Google Maps API components creating search elements
4. React component re-rendering issues
5. CSS conflicts causing visual duplication

## Search Locations Found
- `client/src/pages/home.tsx` (line 523): Main search input
- `client/src/pages/requirements.tsx`: Separate requirements filter (different page)

## Console Logs Added
- 'SEARCH QUERY:' logs when typing
- 'FOUND PROSPECT:' logs when prospect found
- 'ADDRESS SEARCH:' logs on Enter press
- 'FOUND ADDRESS:' logs when address geocoded

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Hard browser refresh (Ctrl+F5)
2. Clear browser cache completely
3. Check developer console for search logs
4. Use rollback if issue persists
