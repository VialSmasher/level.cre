Replace the “Recent XP Gains” list on the Broker Stats page with a visual “Brick Wall” progress component.

Scope: only the stats page + a new component. Do NOT change map, CRM, leaderboard, or auth.

Files:
- client/src/pages/stats.tsx            // replace list section with <BrickWall />
- client/src/components/BrickWall.tsx   // new component
- server/storage.ts or hooks that fetch XP events (read-only; reuse existing endpoint)

Requirements:

1) Data
- Reuse the same XP events the list used. Each event has: id, category, xp, action, created_at.
- Add a time window selector (7d | 30d | All), default 30d; filter events client-side for now.

2) Brick aggregation
- UNIT_XP = 10. Each full 10 XP = 1 brick. Ignore leftover remainder (or carry to next event if easy).
- Expand events into an array of bricks: { id: string, category, action, created_at }.
- Cap to the most recent 1,200 bricks to keep render smooth.

3) Component API
<BrickWall
  events={filteredEvents}
  unitXp={10}
  columns={{ desktop:16, tablet:10, mobile:6 }}
/>

4) Rendering
- Render bricks in a responsive CSS grid; left→right, top→bottom.
- Brick style: 16×8 px (desktop), gap 2 px, border-radius 2 px.
- Colors by category:
  prospecting: var(--color-prospecting, #1E90FF)
  followup:    var(--color-followup,    #10B981)
  consistency: var(--color-consistency, #F59E0B)
  knowledge:   var(--color-knowledge,   #6366F1)
- Tooltip on hover/focus: “{Category} · {action} · +{unitXp} XP · {date time}”.
- Entrance animation: fade+scale for newly appended bricks (CSS only).

5) Milestones
- Every 100 bricks (i.e., 1,000 XP), render a thin horizontal milestone divider with a small label chip:
  “Milestone: {totalXp} XP / Level {computedLevel if available}”.
- The divider spans the grid width and sticks between rows.

6) Legend
- Small legend below the wall with colored dots + labels for the four categories.

7) Time window UI
- Place a compact SegmentedControl (“7d / 30d / All”) above the wall. Changing it re-filters and re-renders.
- Keep the rest of the Broker Stats page intact.

8) Accessibility & empty state
- Each brick uses aria-label with details.
- If there are no events in the window, render:
  “No XP yet — add a prospect or log a follow-up to start building your wall.”

9) Acceptance
- The “Recent XP Gains” list is replaced by the Brick Wall section.
- Bricks appear with correct colors and tooltips; totals visually increase as new events are logged.
- Time window switch updates the wall correctly.
- Performance is smooth with 1,000+ bricks.
- No changes to the rest of the app behavior.

Optional (nice-to-have, only if quick)
- Support partial bricks for remainder XP (render with a diagonal clip or 50% opacity).
