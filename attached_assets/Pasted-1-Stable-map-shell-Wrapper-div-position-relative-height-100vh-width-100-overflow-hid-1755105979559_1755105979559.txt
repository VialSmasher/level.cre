1) Stable map shell
   - Wrapper div: position: relative; height: 100vh; width: 100%; overflow: hidden;
   - Inside: one child div for the map canvas, position: absolute; inset: 0;
   - Render ONLY <GoogleMap> (and markers/polygons/DrawingManager) inside the map canvas.

2) Search bar
   - ONE search bar only (remove duplicates).
   - Place it TOP_LEFT, above the drawing toolbar, similar to Google My Maps default.
   - Absolutely position with a small top margin so it doesn’t overlap nav or map attribution.
   - z-index high enough to sit above map controls.
   - Debounce input (~200ms) so typing doesn’t cause UI jank.
   - Search must allow filter by asset name OR pan/zoom to a selected asset.

3) Legend + filters
   - Legend bottom-left, clickable to toggle status filters.
   - Status order: Prospect → Contacted → Followup → Meeting → Client → No go.
   - Match colors between legend and map markers/polygons.
   - Add a "Clear filters" chip.

4) Drawing toolbar
   - useJsApiLoader({ libraries: ['drawing'] }) and render <DrawingManager> only after isLoaded === true.
   - Keep drawing tools at TOP_LEFT, below the search bar.
   - onOverlayComplete:
     - Marker ⇒ GeoJSON Point {type:'Point', coordinates:[lng,lat]}
     - Polygon ⇒ GeoJSON Polygon (closed ring)
     - Save new assets with default: {status:'prospect', name:'', notes:''}
     - Remove the freehand overlay after saving (re-render from state).

5) Other floating UI
   - Profile/User card bottom-right, control panel top-right, import/export buttons top-right.
   - Absolutely position, z-index above map, but use `pointer-events: none` on outer wrapper and `pointer-events: auto` on clickable children so map panning works underneath.

6) CSV import
   - After import, update state and re-render assets immediately.
   - Deduplicate by (name + address) OR (name + lat + lng).
   - Show toast summary: inserted / updated / skipped.

7) Performance + responsive
   - Ensure full-height map always visible.
   - Overlays wrap on small screens; max-widths set for smaller viewports.
   - Keep styling minimal (plain CSS or existing utility classes).

ACCEPTANCE:
- Map fills screen and stays stable while typing in the search bar.
- Only one search bar exists, top-left above drawing tools.
- Legend and control panel collapse/expand with state remembered in localStorage.
- Drawing toolbar works; drawn shapes save and persist.
- CSV import updates immediately with summary toast.
- Floating UI doesn’t block normal map pan/zoom.
